Question 5
a. Output:
[4,8,12,16,20]

b. Output:
[2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20]

c. No ! The outputs are not the same. In part a, the filter happened first (filtered in the array even numbers), then took those numbers * 2. 
In part b, the map function took all the numbers in the array * 2, then filter all the even numbers 
(which in this case, all the numbers are odd because they already * 2 )
